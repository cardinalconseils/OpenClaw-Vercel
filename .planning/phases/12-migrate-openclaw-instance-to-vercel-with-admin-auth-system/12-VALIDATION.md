# Phase 12 — Validation Strategy

> Per-phase validation contract for feedback sampling during execution.

---

## Test Infrastructure

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Framework** | vitest |
| **Config file** | frontend/vitest.config.ts |
| **Quick run command** | `npm test -- --run` |
| **Full suite command** | `npm test -- --run` |
| **Estimated runtime** | ~15 seconds |

---

## Sampling Rate

- **After every task commit:** Run `npm test -- --run`
- **After every plan wave:** Run `npm test -- --run`
- **Before `/gsd:verify-work`:** Full suite must be green
- **Max feedback latency:** 15 seconds

---

## Per-Task Verification Map

| Task ID | Plan | Wave | Requirement | Test Type | Automated Command | File Exists | Status |
|---------|------|------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | unit/integration | `npm test -- --run` | ❌ W0 | ⬜ pending |

*Status: ⬜ pending · ✅ green · ❌ red · ⚠️ flaky*

---

## Wave 0 Requirements

- [ ] `src/__tests__/admin-auth.test.ts` — admin role middleware tests
- [ ] `src/__tests__/proxy.test.ts` — WebSocket/HTTP proxy route tests
- [ ] Existing vitest infrastructure covers base test needs

*If none: "Existing infrastructure covers all phase requirements."*

---

## Manual-Only Verifications

| Behavior | Requirement | Why Manual | Test Instructions |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| OpenClaw Control UI loads at /admin | Deploy | Requires running Railway + OpenClaw gateway | Visit /admin after deploy, verify SPA loads |
| WebSocket connection works through proxy | Deploy | Requires live WebSocket server | Open /admin, verify real-time features (logs, chat) work |
| Domain murphy.help resolves to Railway | DNS | DNS propagation timing | Check murphy.help resolves after cutover |

---

## Validation Sign-Off

- [ ] All tasks have `<automated>` verify or Wave 0 dependencies
- [ ] Sampling continuity: no 3 consecutive tasks without automated verify
- [ ] Wave 0 covers all MISSING references
- [ ] No watch-mode flags
- [ ] Feedback latency < 15s
- [ ] `nyquist_compliant: true` set in frontmatter

**Approval:** pending
